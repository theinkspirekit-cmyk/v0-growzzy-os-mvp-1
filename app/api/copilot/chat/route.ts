1. **ROAS Optimization**: Focus on campaigns with ROAS below 2.5x - consider pausing or reallocating budget
2. **Creative Refresh**: Update ad creatives that are older than 7-10 days to maintain engagement
3. **Budget Allocation**: Shift 20% of budget from underperforming to top-performing campaigns
4. **Targeting Refinement**: Review audience targeting and exclude non-converting segments

Would you like me to analyze specific campaigns for detailed recommendations?`

• **Daily Budget**: Start with ₹500-1000 per campaign for testing
• **Scale Strategy**: Increase budget by 20% weekly when ROAS > 3.0x
• **Reallocation**: Move budget from campaigns with ROAS < 1.5x to better performers
• **Seasonal Adjustments**: Increase budget during peak shopping seasons

Current campaigns show varied performance. Would you like specific budget recommendations?`

1. **Product Focus**: Prioritize products with highest margins
2. **Audience Testing**: Test new interest-based audiences weekly
3. **Ad Copy**: A/B test headlines and descriptions
4. **Landing Pages**: Ensure fast loading and mobile optimization
5. **Retargeting**: Implement cart abandonment campaigns

Your current blended ROAS is around 2.8x. There's room for improvement to reach 3.5-4.0x range.`
